Every public image alt is exactly `{title} by {author}`. The six front-cover URLs are byte-for-byte values from canonical records; the cover audit reported zero broken sources.

## Approved audiobook truth

Only these slugs are returned in `shelves.approved_audiobooks` and only these receive an `audiobook_url`:

- `book-2b9853ec52` → `/api/reader/book/book-2b9853ec52/audiobook`
- `a-ghost-story` → `/api/reader/book/a-ghost-story/audiobook`
- `sredni-vashtar` → `/api/reader/book/sredni-vashtar/audiobook`

The phone visual uses `book-2b9853ec52`, the first approved audiobook in deterministic curation order. `bn-066`, `radharani`, and `pride-and-prejudice` remain reader-first with no Listen CTA or public audio URL. Great Expectations and Jane Eyre are absent from the 32-title Sprint 1 contract and cannot enter the approved audiobook shelf.

## Omitted from visual placement

These reader-enabled Sprint 1 records were omitted because the canonical artifact did not provide a safe front-cover URL: `pather-panchali`, `devdas`, `book-edfcf810c5`, `frankenstein`, `jekyll-and-hyde`, `picture-of-dorian-gray`, `white-fang`, `the-tell-tale-heart`, `the-last-leaf`, `the-masque-of-the-red-death`, `the-yellow-wallpaper`, `the-monkeys-paw`, and `the-necklace`.

## Validation

- Backend home curation: **8 passed**.
- Current audiobook truth suites: **36 passed**.
- B2 routing suite in isolation: **5 passed**.
- Frontend full suite: **18 suites, 90 tests passed**.
- Full repository regression: **27 backend tests, 90 frontend tests, production build, and browser e2e passed** after updating the retired headline assertion to the authorized dynamic-hero contract.
- GO LIVE static regression: **14 suites passed, 2 intentionally skipped; 123 tests passed, 4 skipped**. Legacy homepage-source assertions now validate `PremiumHero`, canonical curation fetches, approved-only listening URLs, responsive CSS, and crawler-visible premium copy.
- Cover audit: **71 audited, 0 broken, 0 typography-only customer covers**.
- Production build: **compiled successfully** with `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=/api`.
- Browser: dynamic payload loaded six hero books; no broken hero images; no hero engineering copy; fresh-tab console errors: none.
- Route checks: `/`, `/library`, and requested `/book/*` routes resolve through the SPA server. Great Expectations renders unavailable and has no audio CTA; `book-2b9853ec52` renders Listen; Pather Panchali renders reader-only/audio-hidden.

The combined legacy backend aggregate still has ten pre-existing assertions that say Dracula is the only live title. Five B2 tests also fail only when run after that legacy module closes the default event loop; the same B2 file passes 5/5 in isolation. These baseline tests were not rewritten as part of the hero sprint.

## Release state

PR #125 passed the backend/frontend/browser regression, GO LIVE regression, and Vercel preview; it merged to `main` as `fcedd09d`. The merged-sha pre-deploy gate, Vercel production deployment, and production canary passed. Crawler-visible premium homepage copy is live.

Backend production is **not validated**. The GitHub Railway job skipped because `RAILWAY_TOKEN` or `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` is missing. Two explicitly scoped local Railway uploads then failed before build with `Failed to create code snapshot` / HTTP 500 (`716910b9-0a56-47e9-9282-8d41bf6586d2`, `801282fb-e494-40da-be51-01f1385d76de`). `/api/home/curated` therefore remains HTTP 404 and the live React hero fails closed without dynamic covers. Existing production audio truth remains intact: the three approved audiobook endpoints return 206 and the tested hidden-audio slugs return 404. `paid_tts.lock` was not touched.
